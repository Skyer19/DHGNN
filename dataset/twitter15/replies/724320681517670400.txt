“ @FoxNews : 340,000 Pledge to Boycott Target over Transgender Bathroom Policy http://bit.ly/1SDheOC ” it won't last!
@PhinsDiehard  @FoxNews  the blame should be put on the transgender community, not Obama.  Very simply, whatever your were born as u go there
@FoxNews  Ignorance promotes fear & fear perpetuates ignorance. No merit to argument against.  @Target  -Stand Firm. #lgbtrights #LGBTEquality
@FoxNews  And if no one knew - but watched Caitlyn Jenner walk into men's bathroom - what would they say?  @Target  #lgbtrights #LGBTEquality
@FoxNews  add me to the list! Birth certificate dictates where you use the bathroom.Target just open the door for pervs,child molesters so on
@FoxNews  Good shorter lines and a marked improvement in the smell.
@FoxNews  They're Walmart shoppers anyway. Woof!
@MediaBiasPolice  @FoxNews  What bathrooms, locker rooms, and showers are FOR BI-SEXUALS??
@FoxNews  What bathrooms, locker rooms, and showers are FOR BI-SEXUALS??
@FoxNews  boycott target all you want. Just means shorter lines for the rest of us and more parking spaces in the lot
@FoxNews  They must be willing to try anything to get their business back to normal. It won't work, most larcenies start in the restrooms.
@FoxNews  if a dude walks into a restroom my wife or daughter is using there WILL be a fucking problem. #BoycottTarget
@Mortoq2  Then you will get charged with a hate crime & lose your job. You can't win this culture war.
@FoxNews  I understand fear predators will use this  @Target  policy as an opportunity to prey on others. Sad people insist on name calling.
@FoxNews  cool! I on the other hand will do more shopping  @Target
@FoxNews  People still shop at  @Target ?   @amazon  is way batter
@FoxNews  lol
@FoxNews  btw target has had gender free bathrooms for a long time now.
@FoxNews  don't care. I'll always go to Target just to avoid Walmart! Always.
@FoxNews  enough already!we have big problems in this country!where someone goes to the bathroom isn't one of them!
@FoxNews  If a man tries to go in a bathroom with my little girls he will end up starting down the barrel of my 40s&w liberals are just sick
@FoxNews  @theclaytonodom  @carlyodom456  sign me up. I pray for the folks but we need to  Protect our children and family not share restrooms
