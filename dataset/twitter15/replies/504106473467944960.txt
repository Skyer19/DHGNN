@lisabonner  @exavierpope  @goldietaylor  He straight up killed Mike in cold blood, IMHO. Total loss of sense of humanity in that cop. Shameful
@lisabonner  Link?
@mamaria33  @lisabonner  it's playing on CNN right now
@lisabonner  I concur completely
@lisabonner  here is the CNN segment: http://cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/us/2014/08/26/ctn-intv-brown-shoot-new-audio.cnn.htmlâ€¦
@lisabonner  Good point
@lisabonner  how's this even make sense , after all, by dorrian johnsons statement there was an initial shot in the car , then a brief chase
