@PJStrikeForce  Never had a doubt. Obama knew exactly what would happen..
@PJStrikeForce  I don't doubt this, but there aren't any sources mentioned (or it'd be "off with their heads", I know).
@PJStrikeForce  @jenndogg1  How could that be?  The Fed Gov said they were out of the game and would not be able to reintegrate.  Yeah right.
@PJStrikeForce  @TerryMiller1113 brilliantly stupid move
@PJStrikeForce  @The13th_Ghost  thank you #WorstPresidentEver!
@libertylover49  @PJStrikeForce  Makes me sick, makes so many sick
@MilitantJD  @PJStrikeForce  More than that Obama should be tried for treason. He has provided material support to terrorists.
@PJStrikeForce  and this!
@PJStrikeForce  @stillnoregrets1
@PJStrikeForce  Wait President Obama assured us that they were going to be under house arrest in Qatar? Would never rejoin. Lies?  @LbrtyNow
@PJStrikeForce  @KayakSandy  surprise, surprise surprise!
@PJStrikeForce  @porfie_moreno  That's just 5 pics of the same guy!
@PJStrikeForce  Well we knew this was bound to happen !
