“ @IGN : Seth Rogen has been cast as Steve Wozniak in the Steve Jobs biopic http://trib.al/h11KljL ” @joewolf_23
@IGN  I thought they would hire an actual actor for that instead of Seth Rogen. The guy plays himself in everything.
@Nuzu_98 doesn't even look like him 
@IGN  I LOVE THIS...  @Sethrogen  as Woz
@IGN  they're making another one
@IGN  ugh wasn't this just done...
@IGN  well this is going to suck...
@IGN  He looks the part! It would interesting seeing him in a film with Bale.
@ign  That's great.
@IGN  @rc_olivas
@IGN  Pretty weird cast at first glance, but this movie might turn out to be alright. We'll see.
@IGN  boooooo Damn jew
@andopzimbabwe  @IGN  FUCK! I hate Rogen
@IGN  so, apparently everybody already forgot about that movie with Ashton Kutcher..
@IGN  @Don_The_Phenom  didnt we see this already
@IGN  @_michaelharney_
@IGN  I wonder if he's gonna be smoking weed and acting like a dumb ass in this movie as well... No talent having mother.......
