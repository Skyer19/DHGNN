@waitwait  oh, that's much less fun ;)
@waitwait  first you said Santa Clause; you're responsible for the nightmares I'll have tonight of Tim Allen coming down my chimney.
@waitwait  and it gets delivered by drone
@waitwait  http://RedditGifts.com is like santa too!
@waitwait  Even better is back a kickstarter, forget about it, get new game months later. It's like a present from your past self.
@waitwait  @amazon  Pre-orders are awesome for this!
@waitwait  @amazon   How you going to forget with two day shipping? Other places...maybe.
@waitwait  @amazon  "Wait! What is this?! PRINTER INK!!!!!"
@FreshlyTee  @waitwait  @amazon  success?
@waitwait  @ToastCrust  Or when an old Kickstarter finally delivers.
