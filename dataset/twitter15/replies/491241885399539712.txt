@independent  So, like HAMAS, Ukraine used #MH17 as a human shield to lunch attacks on targets in the seperatists' region
@Independent  maximum altitude of the Su-25 is only 7 kms (7000 meters, 23,000 feet). MH17 was flying at 10,000 meters, about 33,000 feet.
@Jarilo_  @Mjakur39Soro  @Independent  There will be PLENTY of satellite footage, You can bet on that -- and from several sources.
@keithmfitz  @Jarilo_  @Independent  I wonder when they will come up with that Sat. Footage. This needs to be solved asap!
@Independent  so they have now admitted the vile act.impeach putin the little shit now.
@Jarilo_  @Mjakur39Soro  @Independent  Sorry...I don't have my own footage. My satellites were parked over Kim Karashian's swimming pool.
@keithmfitz  @Jarilo_  @Independent  don't make Kanye hurt you bro lmao! Thanks for the laugh.
@Jarilo_  @keithmfitz  @Independent  so what do you think happened?
@Mjakur39Soro  @Jarilo_  @Independent  Sounds like it was almost certainly a BUK mobile SAM, given to the separatists by Russia (recently).
@Jarilo_  @keithmfitz  @Independent  ok, what are trying to say?
@Mjakur39Soro  @Jarilo_  @Independent  Let's see what a credible investigation finds. I suspect there will be plenty of good evidence available
@Independent  @yashalevine  An Su-25? 30K ft. really pushing performance envelope. Seems odd choice of plane, to say nothing of source.
@Jarilo_  @Mjakur39Soro  @Independent  The BUK is not too difficult to operate, with a bit of training. They were also seen crossing the border
@keithmfitz   @Independent  have you seen the Russian defence vid on this issue?
@Jarilo_  @Mjakur39Soro  @Independent  Not at all. Plus the BUK has an autonomous mode. It can be set to track, target, & fire on its own.
@Jarilo_  @Mjakur39Soro  @Independent  Are you watching "Russia Today" again?
@Independent  #MH17 give us proof!!!
@Jarilo_  @keithmfitz  @Independent  what do you see in them because I can't decipher them.
@Jarilo_  @keithmfitz  @Independent  buk # 213 where did yOu see that?
@Independent  why won't the Kiev regime reveal their radar data? What do they have to hide?
@Jarilo_  @9toedsleuth  @Independent  I think there will be severe consequences for whoever shot it down. Let's see.
@Jarilo_  @keithmfitz  @Independent  You've a lot to learn keith http://philsreport.blogspot.co.uk/search?q=BBC+Ukraine… BBC Now Admits: Armed Nazis Led “Revolution” in Kiev!
@9toedsleuth  @Jarilo_  @Independent  I don't defend them, and I'm aware SOME were fascists. Still doesn't justify Russia's invasion.
@Jarilo_  @keithmfitz  @Independent  I saw the video and at this point I can only wait on the evidence Kerry said we had.
@Jarilo_  @9toedsleuth  @Independent  Already got one... #Chechnya
@Jarilo_  @9toedsleuth  How many buses did it take to bring those crowds across the border?
@keithmfitz  @Jarilo_  0
@Jarilo_  @keithmfitz  @Independent  i didn't think you guys had a sense of humour lol.
" @Independent : Ukrainian military jet  "flying close" to #MH17 before it was shot down, says Russian officer in attempt to deflect blame
@Independent  @rykov
