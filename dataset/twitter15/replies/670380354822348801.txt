@nytimesphoto  @nytimes  send em back.
@AndrewArocho  @nytimes  @nytimesphoto  You obviously have never been to Detroit. Because you would t make that comment if you had.
@nytimesphoto  @nytimes  Welcome to America.
@nytimesphoto  @nytimes  Detroit has a huge Muslim community. I'm happy for this family. Welcome to the United States
@AndrewArocho If you read the story, they are in Bloomfield Hills. And crime happens everywhere.
@nytimesphoto  @nytimes   find this family in five years and see what kind of bank loans they get and what kind of business end up owing
@nytimesphoto  @nytimes  After 10-years of Islamic radicalism Americans do worry.  Despite the concerns many declare USA is #1 for freedom.
@nytimesphoto  @nytimes  glad you made it guys
@nytimesphoto  @maggieNYT  Yeah hey maybe y'all could do one of those cutesy stories about the ISIS fighter who just arrived in US too.
@AndrewArocho @TheLimerickLane  @nytimes  @nytimesphoto  Don't just mouth off about Detroit. It's pretty damn safe where they're living.
@nytimesphoto  @nytimes  Who pays for all this? Liberal Democrat voters? Hillary's Foundation? The Chinese? The Saudis?
@nytimesphoto  @nytimes  ...blanket stereotyping needs to stop.  Try this:  every non Muslim befriend one and watch the fear melt away.
@nytimesphoto  @nytimes   How pitiable ! Sailors in the lost ark riding on the crest of the hostile waves surrounded by gaping jaws of ocean.
@nytimesphoto  @Refugees  Welcome!
@nytimesphoto  @Refugees  do you have a picture of the Boston bombers on their first day in America?
@nytimesphoto  @Refugees  Where are all the christian refugees from Syria and Iraq!? Only 53 saved while over 2000 muslims!!?!
@nytimesphoto  @Refugees  no one understands how difficult is it to be a refugee even with a safe country u have to worry about acceptance
