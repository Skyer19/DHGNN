@FoxNews  hey we need a good waterboarding guy to see what they where up to. And go get the people that let them roam our country.
@FoxNews  at least SOMEBODY watches over their southern border. Are Canadians protesting??
@FoxNews  Ah, the sixties are alive in the persons of Afghan soldiers. Dodging service should be familiar to several who became conservatives
@FoxNews  So...were they trying to kill Canadians as suggested by #ISIS...or...?
@FoxNews  Found near Niagra Falls? Slowly I turned, step by step, inch by inch...
@FoxNews  when you consider that an American Maj.General was murdered by someone posing as an Afghanistan soldier, this is inexcusable.
@FoxNews  why do we keep bring them in to this country, so they could come and hit us on the back side. Close the boarders, NOW!
@FoxNews  these idiots don't have to sneak over the unprotected border BO , stink in WH will bring them over here. Maybe next fence jumper...
@FoxNews  That sounds about right!!
“ @FoxNews : #BREAKING: Missing Afghan soldiers reportedly found near Canadian border http://fxn.ws/1rg7oEN” @CoreyCheramie  have you seen em?
@EricHarris59  @FoxNews  I knew those guys looked suspicious. They were trying to cross the border in a John boat just above the falls!
Close our #border (s) now. “ @FoxNews : #BREAKING: Missing Afghan soldiers reportedly found near Canadian border http://fxn.ws/1rg7oEN”
“ @FoxNews : #BREAKING: Missing Afghan soldiers reportedly found near Canadian border” well thank God Canada guards its borders.
@FoxNews  @michellemalkin  are we that stupid?  Why have these people on our homeland ?
