@toddstarnes  @Target  @AmericanFamAssc  @FoxNews  God get over it. As long as Target pays for a separate bathroom - let 'em.
@furmanla46  @AmericanFamAssc  @Target  isn't paying for separate restrooms. Any guy can claim he's transgendered & walk into women's room.
@LeahsLounge  ?? It's lower than where it was last year.  Not hard to look up...
@toddstarnes  @Target  @AmericanFamAssc  Good riddance. Target is lame and not worthy of our consumer dollars
@alsebsanset  @toddstarnes  @Target  @AmericanFamAssc  @FoxNews  My household, too.
@LeahsLounge  @Target  I'm sorry, your tweet shows highest 85. It's now 80. 80 is not higher than 85. Has risen today though. Down in last wk.
@LeahsLounge  his tweet is not a lie. Since the boycott, stock has fallen. Not a lie...
@LeahsLounge  I know 80 is less than 85. That's about all I need to know for this discussion.
@LeahsLounge  his point was stocks fallen since boycott. You called him a liar. Your point has nothing do do with his point.

@alsebsanset    Because you're mad about a store being trans-inclusive, probably due to fear of something that doesn't happen anyway.
@toddstarnes  @Target  @AmericanFamAssc  Hope they're also planning to boycott the #Catholic church. #priests #spotlight
. @toddstarnes  So did  @Walmart  stock.  Your point is?  @Target  @AmericanFamAssc
@alsebsanset  @AmericanFamAssc  @toddstarnes  @Target  @FoxNews  and you think other stores you shop in don't support this?
