@pennjillette  @CHSommers  Top strategist no, if you read the piece.  She was redundant in Oct. when Super Pac folded. Makes some valid points
. @pennjillette  @CHSommers  Feminist rag, hit piece, deceptive headline, non-substantive criticism…
.@TheSuitSalesman  @pennjillette  @xojanedotcom  Trump supporters LOVE the fact that feminists hate Trump. He feeds on your rage!
@pennjillette  @DJGrothe  @xojanedotcom  I found this. 3/24 in the menu w/screenshots from 3/22
@pennjillette  @CHSommers  “I alone can solve it” was obviously referring to him in respect to the other candidates. This girl is a fool.
@pennjillette  @SCegielskiPR  Fake story. She was never for him
@pennjillette  @DJGrothe  @SCegielskiPR  Wow. Trump supporters should read this article.
@pennjillette  She left over 6 months ago if that's worth anything.
@pennjillette  Also, read her tweets, she was never his "strategist".
@pennjillette  @SCegielskiPR  interesting read. Trump keeps saying make America great again so can Trump say how America is deficient?
@pennjillette  @AandGShow    Already debunked.
@pennjillette  @mandystadt  fancy writing by a publicist... Shocker that it seems believable. Bunch of suckers if you believe her!

@pennjillette  @SCegielskiPR  and how does all of that make Trump different than Clinton?
@pennjillette  @SCegielskiPR  It's an attack piece, for sure, but from the "Take it from someone who knows him," POV.
@pennjillette  Follow a donkey or an elephant too long, and you'll eventually get dumped on. #twotyrants #buythebook
