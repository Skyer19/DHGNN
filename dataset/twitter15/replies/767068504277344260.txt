People get your facts straight..
I wish really to mention for even a single time the Russian airstrick
Really makes you think. We should fling open the gates and allow a bunch of sexually frustrated military aged men who hate the US in
Shame on war


sick mind
yeeeeeeiiiiiii to .'democracy.' this is terrible very terrible
God bless his soul
true, because George bush wasn't our president from 2000 to 2008. And he didn't start any wars right?
omg no way :(
ang sad niyan. :'(
not a word about victims of US airstrikes.
@CNN  
heartbreaking
@owenil  
no one on the Internet really cares, a post saying your crying is not going to change anything.
humanity shamed once again!!!


So because trump was against it (which he wasn't) that means that bush didn't do anything to cause turmoil in the Middle East?
Don't be sad. It's a lie. Watch his 10yrs old brother. https://youtube.com/watch?v=7cfBmRW3isc…

My god how sad,it this what humanity has become. The world should hang its head in shame.
Too many iconic pictures and yet not much is being done to save lives.
later. Hahahaha.
thanks for the information. I truly wish the best for this young boy. So sad...
Lonely, shocked, scared and silent. His silence says more than all our comments.
We get emotionally upset with such pics, rightly so. What abt exposing the shenanigans of the leaders of such countries?
horribly sad
@cnn  When will the madness of killing children end? Looking away & turning off TV is not the solution.
Those that are responsible for your pains we never go unpublished. You are too young an innocent of the war in Syria.
Ya Allah, oh lord, be with him. Be against everyone behind what has happened to him.
can y'all stop posting this picture? I know this kid isn't getting credit or money from having his face everywhere.
Poor kid ...
