@espn  #IRemember
@espn  Way to go Magic Johnson epic
@espn  was lucky enough to hear him at speaking event 2 years ago. Very talented and poised. Hated I didn't win the tickets to a lakers game
@espn  ...and he's still making it reign!   #Positivity
@espn  GOAT
@espn  I like him in TV don't know him personally so very happy for him.
@espn  look how much bigger he was when he returned. Could no longer play the point guard position. I guess the HIV meds made him gain weight
@espn  And on this date in 2016, Karl Malone is still an asshole about it.
