@GrFitzpatrick  @GuardianUS  hope so!! Soon too!
@GuardianUS  @GerardMulligan1  not only how could someone abandon him, but what about owners who just sold him online.  #cruel
@GuardianUS  breaks my heart..have 3 rescue dogs. They rescued me. All from the same shelter!
@GuardianUS  @morgfair  How sad. I hope they find a loving home for him. I would take this dog!
@GuardianUS  Dogs are always loyal and loving towards their keepers. How could anyone do such a thing??
@GuardianUS  @vallie  I FELT LIKE DOING this to my frisky (dominate) dogs last week! would never follow through on that thought though~ SAD
@davy090  @GuardianUS  I Hope so too!
@GuardianUS  @morgfair  WTF is wrong with people?
