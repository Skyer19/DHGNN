@TheEcuamatador oh yea been seeing that I bet they could get a badass stadium, less of a drive then Oakland too. Plus it's Vegas baby!
@lopez138  yeah that's a lot closer than Oakland lol plus sin city and the raiders would be a perfect match lol
@espn  How about, San Jose Raiders?!
@espn  you mean Vegas would want us crazy raider fans in sin city ok
@espn  makes sense
@espn  Sin City Syth
@espn  oh yes - https://teespring.com/las-vegas-raiders….
@espn   Sure! I would be fine with that. Nice ring to it
@espn  on to Vegas!
@espn  should change the name to choke land traiders
@espn  sounds Brilliant.
@espn  I wonder why the Raiders don't play in santa clara with the 49ers. This will keep them in the area. It's a new stadium, just saying.
@espn  NOOOOO ....  @Ese_Stranger  LOOK
