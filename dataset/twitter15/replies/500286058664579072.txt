@TracyMo53321503  @mashable  are you really justifying the murder of an unarmed kid? o
@mashable  @AdamBaldwin  whoops!
@mashable  @AdamBaldwin  Waiting to see an outpouring of sympathy for the owner of the store that was attacked.  Not holding my breath.
@mashable   where oh where is the selective outrage for hundreds of young black men getting killed by other black men?
@mashable  @progress4ohio doesn't excuse murder
@mashable  that dude is huge
@DrydenNeal  @mashable  no it reads cam 6
@mashable  red hat?
@mashable  if the officer did his job he would be arrested not murdered. Still the point.
@mashable  umm wasn't Mike Brown wearing pants, and shoes?
@DrydenNeal  @mashable  true, but to clarify the date stamp is correct. Not saying its him by any means
@mashable  so he isn't the only victim
@mashable  If this is real, I feel one of those #aweshit moments coming on both sides, the neighborhood and the police.
@mashable  @Karnythia  How about they release some info on the shooting? You know, something that actually has something to do with Mike Brown
@mashable  Hmm the date stamp is accurate however why is it overlayed on top of the crappy stills?  FAKE FAKE
@mashable  Don't you need to send a criminal to court with proper legal protection? Police execution is more crural than death sentence.
@mashable  Now for the real truth, seems the police officer was attacked by violent criminals.
@mashable  I can't believe the comments that are given peeps r blind!
@mashable  @DrydenNeal  *camera6/date 8-9-14  @11 :53am No excuse to shoot him if he truly didn't reach for cops gun! #JusticeForMikeBrown
@DrydenNeal  @mashable  @11   I have no doubt there is more to this story!
@mashable  @drgoddess  And it starts...
@mashable  looks like he's 25 not 18.
@species8472xgn  @mashable  @PDPJ  my brother played, I'm familiar with their size
@mashable  The truth is both sides are looking for a fight , This can only end badly  when both sides use righteous indignation as excuses.
@mashable  When did u move from a tech agent to an investigator. Never saw a tweet about human controversy 'til today. What Bias! #Unfollowed
@mashable  Wow!
@mashable  @coff33loveit  Oh, you mean there's more to the story?
@DrydenNeal  @mashable  I totally agree!
@mashable  this is not Michael Brown. Tell the #FergusonPoliceDepartment to try again...
@at_the_foxhole  @TracyMo53321503  @zadiaz  @mashable  then what's the relevance?
@mashable  you all get off your "jump to conclusions" mat already until the investigation is over
@at_the_foxhole  @TracyMo53321503  @zadiaz  @mashable  still unclear in the context of the shooting of an unarmed teen. But ok.
@NedicLore good piece of evidence to bad the officer was still wrong for murdering a strong armed robbery
@Shizz_latin  @NedicLore Right now there is only one side out. I wonder if there was a dash cam, was it on? Mic?? That would help for sure.
