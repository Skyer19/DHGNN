@scrowder  @Target  Wal-Mart dropped 3.6% during same time. Why?
@scrowder  @Target  I hope they go out of business. I used to love them but no more. Cut up my cards.
@scrowder  People arent #transphobic everyone want trans to be comfortable just dont want pedos to have easy access by pretending to be trans
@scrowder  @Target  lets keep that sucker dropping until they file bankruptcy #BoycottTarget
@scrowder  @Target  oh, get over it.
@scrowder  @Target  y'all realize Walmart policy does not discriminate against trans employees so wouldn't that mean restrooms as well #think
@scrowder  @Target  I hope no one drinks Starbucks, or goes to Barnes & Noble same policy I am far right Christian Luke 6:37 Matt 7:1
@scrowder  @Just_a_Texan  @Target
. @scrowder  @Draconis  @Target  Appeasing SJWs causes loss of business Who knew? /Glares at  @intel
@scrowder  @Target  Except there's no hard evidence it has anything to do with this 'boycott'
@scrowder  @Target  Like seriously, eat shit Crowder. I hate SJWs but I hate you too and don't give a fuck about this.
