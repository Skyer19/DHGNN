@DLoesch  In pictures & video of refugees. There seem to be more 18-30 yr old males than 3 year old children. Pres has never seen the pics
@DLoesch  Have you ever seen a 3 yr old shoot a gun? They might be on to something!
@DLoesch  I thank GOD everyday I find people like you who think like me!
@DLoesch  keep speaking to whomever will listen especially for those of us who don't have a platform!
@DLoesch  Settle them in Chicago. No guns there. Its one big gun free zone...
@DLoesch  if they are over three we put themon a raft in the middle of the pacific#chum
@DLoesch  like good lord, last I check these "Syrian refugees" look to be between 18 to 25ish, all males, so cut the crap progressives.
@DLoesch  let me guess you are the oh so compassionate religious right?
@Patrick_Hulley  @DLoesch  we already have 11 million Latinos "immigrating". The Saudis, Egyptians, etc need to absorb them
@DLoesch  3 YO orphans? If that is so, the only vetting needed would be for foster/adopt parents.
@DLoesch  well,  they aren't because they gave them their guns.
@DLoesch  probably because 3 year old orphans grow up to be teen age terrorist!
@DLoesch  @hrkbenowen  Stop asking great questions!!! They're gonna call you a racist!!!,
@RyanBLeslie  train them young so they will be filled with hate ready for terrorist activities.
@DLoesch  Dana, please research and popularize European refugee demographics if u can. Many were the Isis demo- single, military-aged men.
@DLoesch  @peaceischrist  I expect their politically correct vetting policies can't tell diff between 3 yr old & single fighting age male
@DLoesch  so those thousands who have already been placed in US are all 3year olds? I don't think so
@DLoesch  @sandrapatriot  curious to know how many men and children are refuges. Photos show only adult men, of bombing age coming
