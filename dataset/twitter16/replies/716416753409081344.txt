@TheNewDeal  it's true! I was there! Clark county #feelingthebern #nvcaucus
@jscrivner  @TheNewDeal  So this is before, what does after look like for #NVcaucus?
@TheNewDeal  Where did we get this information?????
@TheNewDeal  confused by how this convention is working, but does this mean Bernie could retroactively win Nevada?
@mpmt3102  @TheNewDeal  I personally didn't see it. But I probably heard the same rumors you did.
@TheNewDeal  @jamesmarie33  He more than likely won the state. Clark greatest concentration of delegates by far. 2nd most county went to Bern
@TheNewDeal  @kujo71  We won't know if he won the state until the NV Convention May 14-15
@SByrne52  @TheNewDeal  Ahh okay, thanks!
@TheNewDeal  please send me a link so I can figure out what's happening? Google isn't helping me.
