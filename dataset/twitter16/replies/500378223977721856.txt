@rolandsmartin  may be prudent to ask clerk if Brown was the one who hit him
@rolandsmartin  Because jaywalking and stealing cigars are capital crimes. It's the classic "Blame the victim" defense.
@rolandsmartin  SUSPICION of a crime results n DEATH of the unarmed in the #Black comm as a rule. #MichaelBrown #EricGarner #TrayvonMartin

@rolandsmartin  their account is getting worse and worse Roland
@Jurutha  if u watch the tape, he reached over counter, still not grounds to shoot him from behind
@Jurutha  I hear ya, but u said the swishers were behind the counter and they were, no biggie
@rolandsmartin  they've been throwing out one lie after another. And none of it makes sense. How was he "prime suspect" just minutes after?
@rolandsmartin  when that didn't made logical sense, now it was jaywalking? And he felt the nd to use deadly force for jaywalking? Lol
Well, yeah.  He had to trash the name of a dead child before providing that little tid bit.  @rolandsmartin
@rolandsmartin  ok so that was mike in the convenience store?
@rolandsmartin  the behavior of some of these people is way way out of control !!! Shameful behavior isn't going to win you a thing! STOP IT!
