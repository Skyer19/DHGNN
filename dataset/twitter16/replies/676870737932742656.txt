@ReverantRevan  @ABC  Makes u wonder who the dealership got the loot from...hum??
@ABC  LOL Too Funny!!!
@zzPopsL  @ABC  because a lot of the wholesale dealers are Arabic and the send them back to the Middle East.
@abc  damn this so bad 2 hell with  that car dealership
@ABC  I don't understand people they need to call the name on the side of the truck and threaten them. Is there no common sense
@ABC  
@hansgruberdies  @ABC  He used it for those tough clogs
@ABC  Will US/NATO stop free flow of materiel from Turkey into Sirya? Or will this add to the belief Daesh serves Western interests there?
@ABC  I would sue for a lot more $$ !!!
@ABC  deck, does that mean the coca cola lorry could soon be seen with missile launchers? Or maybe MacDonalds all day breakfast truck
