RIP  RT  @Variety : Judy Carne, “Laugh-In’s” “sock it to me” girl, dies at 76
@Variety  @frankp316   I remember wanting watch that show, and my parents would not let me because of some of the "Adult" jokes.
@Variety  @frankp316   I would sneak out of my bed and watch as much as I could before being sent back to bed. I do not remember as much
@Variety  @frankp316   As much as the others. But I am sorry for her. She sounds like she had a hard, tough life.
Her light burned bright - for a short time. RIP  @Variety  #judycarne
@Variety   I remember her well she was one of  the sock it to me girls rest in peace Miss Judy!?
