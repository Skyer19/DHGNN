@SandraALTX  @ChestnutPrince  it takes 5sec to sign the #BoycottTarget petition so do it! https://afa.net/action-alerts/sign-the-boycott-target-pledge/â€¦
@SandraALTX  @KarrattiPaul boycott Target stores We shouldn't have to accept every fruit nut & flakes so their feelings don't get hurt
@SandraALTX  Target's stock did not plummet because of this policy!
@undergradwoman  @SandraALTX  Then tell us why it fell then.
@SandraALTX  Take the #TargetShoppingCartChallenge !  #Favorite and #RT #Retweet if you like the idea.
@PC_GoneWild  @SandraALTX  Brilliant!
@SandraALTX  @Callisto1947  target won't prosecute minority shop lifters and Disney hasn't for years good looting retailers spread the word
@SandraALTX  @RotNScoundrel  A perfect example of why we don't need government regulations.
@SandraALTX  @Westxgal  boycott Trump and Clinton they both think it is ok they agree with Target.
@SandraALTX  @Westxgal  Don't forget about me 1000001
